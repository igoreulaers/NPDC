# Norwegian Polar Data Centre

This repo provides a library of search queries, each delivering a specific pollutant dataset (including metatda), of the Norwegian Polar Institute Data Centre.

Each query offers four different output formats:

-   simple: quick 'n' dirty with essential data (species, matrix, locality, data)
-   extended field: essential data are extended with field metadata
-   extended lab: essential data are extended with lab metadata
-   extended field and lab: essential data are extended with both field and lab metadata

Before running the chunk of code for each of these output formats, first run the "background process".
